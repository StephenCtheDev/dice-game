Dice Rolling Game

Description:
This is a simple dice rolling game that simulates rolling two dice. It displays the rolled numbers on the dice, animates them in a 3D space, and keeps track of how many times the "Roll Dice" button has been clicked. The program updates the total count each time the button is clicked. It also calculates the odds of getting a specific combination of dice rolls and displays that information.

Features:
Dice Animation: 3D rolling effect when the dice are rolled.

Total Roll Counter: Tracks the total number of times the dice button is clicked.

Combination Odds: Displays the odds of rolling specific combinations of dice.

Comments:
I cannot get the dice to always show the number highlighted. That is why there is a number announcer at the top. I will update when I am able to. IF anyone cares to take a shot at it by all means feel free.
